# xylo-api
Public version of my personal API which interacts with multiple of my projects like Hopper Client

## Testing
- You can use the [HopperMC CLI](https://github.com/hoppermcteam/hoppermcteam/tree/main/interactions) to create a testing environment and interact with this API on the command line.

## Production
- This is not production and will not write to any of my services.
- This will not integrate with my services unless you use my production services.
- This will only work for Sandbox testing currently.
